INSERT INTO lot(sellerId, categoryId, lotName, description, imageUrl, startingBid, startDate, endDate) VALUES (@sellerId, @categoryId, @lotName, @description, @imageUrl, @startingBid, @startDate, @endDate)

SELECT * FROM lot INNER JOIN bid ON lot.lotId = bid.lotId  WHERE lot.lotId = @lotId AND WHERE bid.bidDate = (SELECT bid.bidDate FROM bid WHERE bid.lotId = @lotId ORDER BY bid.bidDate DESC LIMIT 1) 

SELECT * FROM lot INNER JOIN bid ON lot.lotId = bid.lotId  WHERE lot.lotId = @lotId ORDER BY bid.bidDate DESC LIMIT 1

SQLDataSourceBid
	SELECT * FROM [bid] WHERE (([lotId] = @lotId) AND ([buyerId] = @buyerId))
	UPDATE bid SET amount = @amount, bidDate = @bidDate WHERE (buyerId = @userId) AND (lotId = @lotId)
	INSERT INTO bid(buyerId, lotId, amount, bidDate) VALUES (@buyerId, @lotId, @amount, @bidDate)

INSERT INTO bid(buyerId, lotId, amount, bidDate) VALUES (@buyerId, @lotId, @amount, @bidDate)

Basic union thing:

SELECT lot.lotId, lot.lotName, bid.amount AS 'Current Bid' FROM lot INNER JOIN bid ON lot.lotId = bid.lotId

UNION

SELECT lot.lotId, lot.lotName, lot.startingBid AS 'Current Bid' FROM lot WHERE lotId NOT IN (SELECT lot.lotId FROM lot INNER JOIN bid ON lot.lotId = bid.lotId)
